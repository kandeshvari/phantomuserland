Q: **What is this Phantom OS? Is it another re-packed Linux clone?**

A: Absolutely not. We do not consider interesting or valuable creation of yet another duplicate of an existing operating system.

Q: **But the new system will require new programs – what kind of programming giant will be required to create them?**

A: A significant number of programs do not need to be re-created – just get moved from the old systems. Let me also draw your attention to the phenomenon of the iPhone. It is based on very specific system (modified MacOS), with all programs created from scratch – even a simple transfer of programs from other operating system is impossible because of a very unusual approach to build a user interface. Barely a year and a half ago, there was no iPhone, nor its operating system or software, and no programmers experienced in writing programs for it. Nevertheless, today there are about ten thousand (10,000) programs for the iPhone.

Q: **All of them are small programs, aren’t they?**

A: Indeed. But it is a modern tendency. Today, it is more convenient to have several small programs, rather than one large. Again, this happens because of simplicity of programs combining, which, again, is economically reasonable. Small programs creation is less risky in terms of investment in the business, so creating several smaller products that together solve bigger task is more cost-effective approach. That is why it prevails today.

Q: **Phantom is similar to Microsoft’s Singularity, isn’t it?**

A: First information about Phantom was published in the Internet in 1998. Description of Phantom’s concept has been sent to Microsoft couple of years before the announcement of Singularity. Sorry, but it is Microsoft Singularity that is similar to the Phantom.

Q: **And so it turns out that you are not so revolutionary?**

A: It would be foolish to hope that we are totally unique. Still there are two or three people in the world capable of going as fast as we can. But – similarity between Phantom and Microsoft’s Singularity does not mean their identity. We have a unique feature that Microsoft has not recognized as a significant value yet, or is unable to implement.

Q: **What is the unique feature of the Phantom OS?**

A: Speaking simply – immortality. Unlike all existing systems Phantom can provide eternal life for all programs working in it. Programs do not need to be ended or finished. This quite changes the whole situation. First, it is convenient – you do not need to close all programs before the shutdown, and then re-open them before you may begin your real work. Secondly, it allows programs to be much simpler – for example, a program no longer needs to be able to record its condition to the file! Only this simplification reduces needed money and time to the same 30%. And there are other features.

Q: **But sometimes you need to turn off the computer. So, the system will be stopped. And then all programs will be stopped, too?..**

A: Let's say otherwise – «hold». For all programs stop of the system will look like a delay in the operation. Like pressing «Pause» on DVD player. After launch of the system all programs will simply «continue».

Q: **This already exists in Windows and it is called Hibernate.**

A: Not so simple. Hibernate requires you to do a special shutdown – if it is not done properly, then all gets lost. So – Windows can not guarantee «eternal life» for programs, which means – software for Windows has to be written as usual. Phantom is able to survive even in a situation when the computer’s power suddenly goes off. After restarting the system it will recover in the same state that it was a few seconds before the spontaneous shutdown.

Q: **That must require enormous resources. Indeed, the system has to constantly «photograph» itself?**

A: The basic know-how of the Phantom is precisely the ability to cheaply create instant snapshots of the system, not stopping it and not making serious disturbances in the job. Delicacy is that «photography» has to capture the whole system at once – no exceptions. Until now it was believed that this calls for a pause in all programs. We have found a way to distribute over time the creation of such a «photos», while leaving its synchronous from the «internals» point of view of the system.

Q: **And do we need it? Maybe go old-fashioned?**

A: You do need. This provides some very significant advantages. The most important of them is a very substantial reduction in the cost of software development. If it has not impressed you, I will try to lead a very simple example. Imagine that you have learned to produce cars 30% cheaper than Toyota or Audi. And software market is not that far from the automarket: in Russia in 2007 only box software was sold for 2.7 billion U.S. dollars. This figure does not include software services and custom software development.

Q: **What markets do you focus Phantom?**

A: Phantom has wide system profile. Technically, it is suitable for all known applications – desktop, mobile, server applications, and special (built-in) systems. But there are areas where the Phantom can express itself very clearly. For example, medicine and military equipment.

Q: **What is so important in Phantom for medicine and military?**

A: Phantom, by virtue of its conceptual simplicity, not only does not lose the state program ahd before sudden shutdown, but very quickly restores back when started. With careful implementation system can recover in just a matter of seconds, and even faster with compact applications. Let’s imagine ER computer standing by the bed of critical patient. It does not matter, why it can suddenly be shut off – due to the cleaners, or failure of backup power – there is a possibility of it switching off for a few seconds. Normal operating system in such conditions barely leaves patient a chance to survive – it has to load itself, check discs, launch programs – alas, it may take minutes! At the same time, Phantom is «born into adulthood» – at the time of launch it already is exactly what it was at the time of failure. All programs are running at once, set up and operational. Now lets move on to the submarine. Imagine that it hits a difficult situation, and the electricity onboard gets disconnected because of malfunctions. Problem gets quickly resolved by the crew, but the boat is still dead: computers are restarting. In the battle situation a few extra tens of seconds may cost lives of the entire team.

Q: **Well – well, all clear about military and medical applications, but where does Phantom benefit on servers?**

A: Do not forget about development being more affordable – server applications traditionally cost a lot of money. But apart from this Phantom has more to offer. Phantom is the system without context switching between kernel and applications. Normal system has two modes – «Almighty» mode, where kernel works, and «Applied» mode, where applications work. This way classic protection systems work in Unix/Linux and Windows OSes. Switch between modes is very expensive and reduces productivity of actual applications software. This is especially strongly evident in server applications. In Phantom protection is built on less costly technology, and modes («protection rings») switching is not required.

Q: **I saw Phantom referenced in connection with Amazon Cloud services. What is the idea?**

A: Amazon Cloud is an environment, intended to launch «images» of operating systems. The idea is that you «revive» desired number of such systems and enjoy them. Phantom fits this environment as «reviving» gives instantly working environment, while traditional Linux after such «reviving» need some way to connect with the data, customize, and run its programs. Again, copy of Phantom may be «sent to sleep» entirely in one motion, while traditional Linux programs are dreary and require special adaptations in order to suit «go sleep» ability.
